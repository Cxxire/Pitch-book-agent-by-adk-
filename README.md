## 🎯 About The Project

> PitchCraft AI is a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to fully automate the creation of comprehensive pitch books and investment reports. It orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents, transforming raw financial data and user requests into a polished, professional, and data-driven document with zero manual intervention.

### ✨ Key Features:

-   **Fully Automated**: From initial request to final report delivery, the process is hands-off.
-   **Modular by Design**: Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the system robust and easy to extend.
-   **Data-Driven**: Integrates with live financial data sources to provide up-to-date analysis.
-   **Consistent & Professional**: Ensures all reports are generated in a standardized, high-quality format.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system is managed by a root **`Pitch_book_agent`** which acts as a project manager. It directs a sequence of specialized sub-agents to gather data, perform analysis, and assemble the final report.

🤝 The Agent Team
Our system is composed of a powerful team of agents, each an expert in its domain.

🟣 Pitch_book_agent (The Conductor)
Role: Root Agent / Project Manager

Function: This agent acts as a silent project manager, strictly orchestrating the sequence of sub-agents. It handles the initial user request and delivers only the final, completed document without any intermediate conversation.

✍️ CGNS_Agent (The Analyst)
Role: Sub Agent / Equity Research Analyst

Function: This agent analyzes pre-fed financial data and news to generate a structured investment summary. It is responsible for creating the core narrative, including the investment rationale and key risks, in a strict format for the next step.

📡 DMIS_Agent (The News Scout)
Role: Sub Agent / Data Retrieval Specialist

Function: This agent gathers the latest market data and recent news about a company from trusted financial sources. Its sole output is to structure this raw, unbiased information into a strict JSON format for other agents to analyze.

📊 FMPS_Agent (The Quant)
Role: Sub Agent / Financial Data Fetcher

Function: This agent collects a comprehensive set of quantitative financial data, from technical indicators to analyst ratings. Its only function is to structure this raw information into a strict JSON object for use by other agents, without performing any analysis.

📑 DVS_Agent (The Assembler)
Role: Sub Agent / Document Finalizer

Function: This is the final agent in the chain. It meticulously combines the pre-written narrative from the Analyst and the raw data from the Scouts into a single, strictly formatted report. It performs no analysis, simply populating a pre-defined template to create the final document.
